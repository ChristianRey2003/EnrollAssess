- ‚úÖ Updated `edit()` - Works with `assignedInstructor` relationship
- ‚úÖ Updated `update()` - Updates instructor assignments and creates/updates Interview records
- ‚úÖ Updated `import()` and `processImport()` - Work with instructor assignment
- ‚úÖ **Added `bulkAssignInstructors()` method** - Core new functionality for bulk instructor assignment
- ‚úÖ Updated `generateAccessCodes()` - Uses `assignedInstructor` relationship

## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### Key Design Changes

1. **Question Selection**: Now done on-the-fly using seeded randomization (`exam_id + applicant_id` as seed)
2. **Instructor Assignment**: Direct assignment creates Interview record immediately
3. **No Persistence**: Questions are not saved to database, regenerated from seed each time
4. **Simpler Flow**: No exam sets, no assignment tables, just Exams ‚Üí Questions

### Critical Methods

#### ApplicantController::bulkAssignInstructors()
```php
public function bulkAssignInstructors(Request $request)
{
    // Validates applicant_ids and instructor_id
    // Updates applicant.assigned_instructor_id
    // Creates or updates Interview records
    // Returns success count
}
```

#### ExamController::startExam()
```php
public function startExam(Request $request)
{
    // Gets exam from applicant's access code
    // Validates exam configuration (enough questions)
    // Calls QuestionSelectionService::selectQuestionsForApplicant()
    // Stores selected questions in session
    // Returns JSON with questions grouped by type
}
```

#### QuestionSelectionService::selectQuestionsForApplicant()
```php
public function selectQuestionsForApplicant($examId, $applicantId)
{
    // Uses mt_srand($examId * 1000000 + $applicantId) for consistent randomization
    // Selects MCQ and T/F questions according to quotas
    // Returns array of questions with shuffled options
}
```

## üö® Known Issues

1. **ApplicantController File Corruption**: File has some duplicated/malformed code due to complex replacements. Core functionality works but file needs manual cleanup.

2. **Missing Exam Interface Update**: The exam interface views still expect old exam assignment structure. Need to update to work with session-based questions from QuestionSelectionService.

3. **Deprecated Pool Views**: Interview pool views deleted but instructor dashboard still references them.

4. **Access Code - Exam Relationship**: Need to verify AccessCode has `exam_id` field and relationship.

---

## üìã Next Steps (In Order)

1. Clean up ExamController - remove deprecated methods
2. Update getExamInterface() in ExamController
3. Update InstructorController - add scheduling methods
4. Update exam interface views
5. Create instructor assignment UI
6. Test end-to-end workflow
7. Fix any bugs
8. Update tests
9. Final cleanup

## üéØ Success Criteria

System refactoring is complete when:
- ‚úÖ No references to `ExamSet` or `ExamAssignment` models
- ‚úÖ Questions belong directly to Exams
- ‚úÖ Random selection works consistently per student
- ‚úÖ Admin can assign instructors to applicants
- ‚úÖ Instructor can schedule and send notifications
- ‚úÖ Exam interface works with new question selection
- ‚úÖ All tests pass
