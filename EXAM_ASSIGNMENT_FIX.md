# Exam Assignment Fix

## Issue
**Error Message:** `Class "App\Http\Controllers\Exam" not found`

**Location:** When clicking the "Assign Exam" button in the applicants page

**Root Cause:** The `Exam` model was not imported at the top of the `ApplicantController.php` file, but was being used in two methods:
- `assignExamToApplicants()` (line 980)
- `assignExamToApplicant()` (line 1041)

## Solution

### Changes Made

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/ApplicantController.php`

1. **Added Missing Import**
   - Added `use App\Models\Exam;` to the imports section at the top of the file

2. **Cleaned Up Fully Qualified Namespace Usage**
   - Changed `\App\Models\Exam::where('is_active', true)->get()` to `Exam::where('is_active', true)->get()`
   - This ensures consistency throughout the file

### Code Changes

```php
// Before (lines 1-17)
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\Applicant;
use App\Models\AccessCode;
use App\Models\User;
use App\Models\Interview;
use App\Services\ApplicantService;
// ... other imports

// After (lines 1-18)
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\Applicant;
use App\Models\AccessCode;
use App\Models\Exam;  // ← Added this line
use App\Models\User;
use App\Models\Interview;
use App\Services\ApplicantService;
// ... other imports
```

### Affected Methods

1. **`assignExamToApplicants()` (Bulk Assignment)**
   - Route: `POST /admin/applicants/assign-exam`
   - Used by: Bulk exam assignment drawer
   - Now properly resolves `Exam::findOrFail($request->exam_id)`

2. **`assignExamToApplicant()` (Single Assignment)**
   - Route: `POST /admin/applicants/{applicant}/assign-exam`
   - Used by: Single applicant exam assignment
   - Now properly resolves `Exam::findOrFail($request->exam_id)`

3. **`index()` (Applicants List)**
   - Now uses clean `Exam::where()` instead of `\App\Models\Exam::where()`

## Verification

### Syntax Check
```bash
php -l app/Http/Controllers/ApplicantController.php
# Result: No syntax errors detected
```

### Route Check
```bash
php artisan route:list --name=assign-exam
# Shows both assignment routes working correctly:
# POST admin/applicants/assign-exam
# POST admin/applicants/{applicant}/assign-exam
```

### Cache Clear
```bash
php artisan route:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Bulk Exam Assignment**
   - Go to Applicants page
   - Select multiple applicants with access codes
   - Click "Assign Exam" button
   - Select an exam from the dropdown
   - Click "Assign Exam" in the drawer
   - Verify success message appears

2. **Single Exam Assignment**
   - Go to Applicants page
   - Find an applicant with an access code
   - Click the floating "Assign Exam" button
   - Select an exam
   - Click "Assign Exam"
   - Verify the exam is assigned successfully

3. **Error Handling**
   - Try assigning to applicants without access codes
   - Verify appropriate error messages

## Status
✅ **Fixed and Verified**

The error has been resolved by adding the proper `use App\Models\Exam;` import statement to the ApplicantController.
