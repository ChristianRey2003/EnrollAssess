## Overview
Cleaned up and enhanced the exam interface proctoring features to ensure fullscreen functionality, copy-paste prevention, and consistent security across both exam interfaces.

---

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. **Added Fullscreen Functionality to Sectioned Interface**
**File**: `resources/views/exam/sectioned-interface.blade.php`

**Added Features**:
- ✅ Automatic fullscreen entry on exam start
- ✅ Cross-browser fullscreen support (Chrome, Safari, IE11)
- ✅ Fullscreen exit detection with violation recording
- ✅ Automatic fullscreen re-entry after exit
- ✅ Violation tracking for fullscreen exits

**Code Added** (lines 491-520):
```javascript
// Fullscreen functionality
function enterFullscreen() {
    const elem = document.documentElement;
    
    if (elem.requestFullscreen) {
        elem.requestFullscreen().catch(err => {
            console.log('Fullscreen not supported or denied:', err);
        });
    } else if (elem.webkitRequestFullscreen) { // Safari
        elem.webkitRequestFullscreen();
    } else if (elem.msRequestFullscreen) { // IE11
        elem.msRequestFullscreen();
    }
}

// Monitor fullscreen exit and warn user
document.addEventListener('fullscreenchange', function() {
    if (!document.fullscreenElement) {
        recordViolation('FULLSCREEN_EXIT', 'You exited fullscreen mode.');
        setTimeout(() => enterFullscreen(), 1000);
    }
});
```

### 2. **Enhanced Violation Monitoring in Sectioned Interface**
**File**: `resources/views/exam/sectioned-interface.blade.php`

**Enhanced Features**:
- ✅ Window blur detection (clicking outside exam window)
- ✅ Comprehensive keyboard shortcut prevention
- ✅ Case-insensitive key detection (c/C, v/V, etc.)
- ✅ Print prevention (Ctrl+P)
- ✅ Refresh prevention (F5, Ctrl+R)
- ✅ Alt+Tab prevention
- ✅ Windows/Command key prevention
- ✅ Right-click context menu prevention

**Added Protections** (lines 566-635):
```javascript
function setupViolationMonitoring() {
    // Tab/Window visibility monitoring
    // Window focus/blur monitoring
    // Developer tools prevention (F12, Ctrl+Shift+I/J/C, Ctrl+U)
    // Copy/Paste/Cut prevention (Ctrl+C/V/X/A)
    // Print prevention (Ctrl+P)
    // Refresh prevention (F5, Ctrl+R)
    // Alt+Tab prevention
    // Windows/Command key prevention
    // Right-click prevention
}
```

### 3. **Extracted Inline CSS to External File**
**File**: `public/css/exam/exam-interface.css`

**Added CSS Sections** (lines 468-660):
- ✅ Violation counter styles (normal, warning, danger states)
- ✅ Pulse animations for warnings
- ✅ Violation modal styles
- ✅ Violation overlay styles
- ✅ Responsive adjustments for mobile devices

**Benefits**:
- Better maintainability
- Faster page load times
- No CSS conflicts

---

### 4. **Improved Page Unload Warning**
**File**: `resources/views/exam/sectioned-interface.blade.php`

**Enhancement** (lines 984-990):
```javascript
// Warn on page unload (only if exam is still active)
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', function(e) {
    if (timeRemaining > 0) {
        e.preventDefault();
        e.returnValue = 'Are you sure you want to leave? Your exam progress may be lost.';
        return e.returnValue;
    }
});
```

**Benefit**: Only warns if exam is still in progress (not after completion)
