# Applicant Login Fix - "An error occurred. Please try again."

## Issue Summary
**Error:** "An error occurred. Please try again." when applicants try to take the exam after logging in with their access code.

**URL:** `http://enrollassess.test/applicant/login`

**Root Cause:** The `/exam/pre-requirements` route was using the old exam system structure (`examSet.exam`) instead of the new question bank system structure (`accessCode.exam`).

## Problem Analysis

### The Error Flow
1. Applicant enters access code at `/applicant/login`
2. System verifies access code successfully
3. Redirects to `/privacy/consent` â†’ `/exam/pre-requirements`
4. **Error occurs** in `/exam/pre-requirements` route at line 46

### The Root Cause
**File:** `routes/public.php` (lines 37-70)

**Problematic Code:**
```php
$applicant = \App\Models\Applicant::with('examSet.exam')->findOrFail($applicantId);
```

**Issue:** The `Applicant` model doesn't have an `examSet` relationship. This was from the old exam system.

### System Architecture Mismatch

**Old System (what the code expected):**
```
Applicant â†’ examSet â†’ exam
```

**New System (what actually exists):**
```
Applicant â†’ accessCode â†’ exam
```

## Solution Applied

### Changes Made

**File:** `routes/public.php`

**Before:**
```php
$applicant = \App\Models\Applicant::with('examSet.exam')->findOrFail($applicantId);

if (!$applicant->examSet || !$applicant->examSet->exam) {
    return redirect()->route('applicant.login')
        ->with('error', 'No exam assigned. Please contact the administrator.');
}

$examSet = $applicant->examSet;
$totalQuestions = $examSet->activeQuestions()->count();
$duration = $examSet->exam->duration_minutes ?? 30;

return view('exam.pre-requirements', compact('examSet', 'totalQuestions', 'duration'));
```

**After:**
```php
// Load applicant with access code and exam relationship
$applicant = \App\Models\Applicant::with('accessCode.exam')->findOrFail($applicantId);

// Check if applicant has an access code
if (!$applicant->accessCode) {
    return redirect()->route('applicant.login')
        ->with('error', 'No access code found. Please contact the administrator.');
}

// Check if exam is assigned to the access code
if (!$applicant->accessCode->exam_id || !$applicant->accessCode->exam) {
    return redirect()->route('applicant.login')
        ->with('error', 'No exam assigned. Please contact the administrator.');
}

$exam = $applicant->accessCode->exam;
$totalQuestions = $exam->activeQuestions()->count();
$duration = $exam->duration_minutes ?? 30;

return view('exam.pre-requirements', compact('exam', 'totalQuestions', 'duration'));
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Correct Relationship:** Now uses `accessCode.exam` instead of `examSet.exam`
2. **Better Error Handling:** More specific error messages for different failure scenarios
3. **Proper Validation:** Checks both access code existence and exam assignment
4. **Compatible Variables:** Passes `exam` variable that the view expects

- `routes/public.php` - Fixed the pre-requirements route logic

## Related Files (No Changes Needed)
- `resources/views/exam/pre-requirements.blade.php` - Already expects `exam` variable
- `app/Models/Applicant.php` - Has correct `accessCode` relationship

## Next Steps
1. Test with other access codes that have exams assigned
2. Verify the exam interface works correctly after this fix
3. Test the complete exam flow from login to submission
