# Sectioned Exam Interface Implementation

## Overview

This implementation replaces the single-question exam interface with a sectioned approach that groups questions by type (Multiple Choice, True/False, Essay) for better clarity and user experience.

## Key Features

### 1. Sectioned Layout
- Questions are grouped by type: Multiple Choice, True/False, Essay
- Each section displays all questions of that type at once
- Clear visual separation between sections
- Progress tracking per section and overall

### 2. Section Management
- Students must complete all questions in a section before submitting
- Once a section is submitted, it cannot be modified
- Sections are processed sequentially
- Visual feedback for completed sections

### 3. Enhanced UX
- Clean, space-efficient design without emojis
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
- Real-time progress tracking
- Auto-save functionality for essay questions
- Violation monitoring preserved from original implementation

### 4. Security Features
- All existing security measures maintained
- Violation tracking and auto-submission
- Prevention of developer tools, copy/paste, etc.
- Tab switching detection

## Technical Implementation

- `POST /exam/complete` - Complete entire exam (existing)

### Controllers

#### ExamController (Enhanced)

- `submitSection()` - Handle section submissions and session management

#### ExamSubmissionController (Updated)

### Database Integration
- Uses existing database structure
- Questions loaded from applicant's assigned exam set
- Automatic grouping by question_type field
- Session state stored in Laravel sessions

### Frontend Features
- Sectioned layout with collapsible/expandable sections
- Real-time progress tracking
- Answer validation before section submission
- Modal confirmations for submissions
- Auto-scroll to next section after completion

## Question Type Support

### Multiple Choice
- Radio button selection
- Option letters (A, B, C, D)
- Single correct answer validation

### True/False
- Radio button selection with True/False options
- Simplified two-option layout

### Essay
- Large text area for responses
- Character count and validation
- Partial credit system (50% for answering)

## Session Management

### Exam Session Structure
```php
[
    'applicant_id' => int,
    'exam_set_id' => int,
    'started_at' => timestamp,
    'duration_minutes' => int,
    'current_section' => int,
    'sections_completed' => array,
    'answers' => array
]
```

### Answer Storage
- Answers stored by question_id as key
- Multiple choice: stores option_id
- Essay: stores text content
- Persistent across page refreshes

## UI Structure
