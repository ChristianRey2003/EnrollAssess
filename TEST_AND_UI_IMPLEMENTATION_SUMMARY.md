## 📝 Testing Instructions

### Running All Tests

**Important**: Before running tests, ensure a fresh test database:
```bash
# Fresh migrate the test database
php artisan migrate:fresh --env=testing
```

```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run specific test file
php artisan test tests/Feature/QuestionSelectionServiceTest.php
php artisan test tests/Feature/ExamAssignmentControllerTest.php
php artisan test tests/Feature/DualExamFlowTest.php

# Run with coverage
php artisan test --coverage

# Run specific test group
php artisan test --group=assignment
```

**Note**: All test files are in `tests/Feature/` directory as they use database operations (integration tests, not pure unit tests).
