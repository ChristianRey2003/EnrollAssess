<!-- ORIGINAL STANDALONE VERSION - BACKUP CREATED DURING REFACTORING -->
<!-- This file contains the original 1,100+ line standalone version -->
<!-- The new version uses the standard admin layout system -->
<!-- Created: {{ date('Y-m-d H:i:s') }} -->
<!-- 
    REFACTORING NOTES:
    - Original file was a standalone HTML document with 1,100+ lines of CSS
    - Did not use the standard admin layout system (@extends('layouts.admin'))
    - Used Inter font instead of the standard Figtree font
    - Had custom styling that duplicated admin layout functionality
    - Missing standard admin navigation sidebar
    - Inconsistent with other admin pages
    
    NEW VERSION:
    - Uses @extends('layouts.admin') for consistency
    - Extracted interview-specific styles to public/css/admin/interviews.css
    - Maintains all functionality while following standard layout patterns
    - Consistent navigation and theming with other admin pages
    - Reduced code duplication significantly
