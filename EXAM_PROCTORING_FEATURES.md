## 📊 Proctoring Effectiveness

### **What This Prevents**:
✅ Tab switching to search answers online  
✅ Copying questions to share with others  
✅ Using external tools or calculators  
✅ Viewing other applications during exam  
✅ Manipulating exam code or timer  
✅ Printing exam for later reference  
✅ Taking screenshots (limited)  
✅ Multiple exam windows open  

### **What This Does NOT Prevent**:
❌ Physical notes or books (requires human proctoring)  
❌ Second device usage (phone, tablet)  
❌ Someone else taking the exam (requires ID verification)  
❌ Advanced screen recording software  
❌ Virtual machine bypass attempts  

**Note**: The system is designed for **standard university entrance exams**, not high-security professional certifications.

## 🎓 Best Practices for Implementation

### **For Students (Pre-Exam Instructions)**:
1. Close all other browser tabs before starting
2. Close all other applications on computer
3. Ensure stable internet connection
4. Use a desktop/laptop (mobile may have limitations)
5. Disable browser extensions if possible
6. Use Chrome or Firefox for best compatibility
7. Understand the 5-violation rule

### **For Administrators (Setup)**:
1. Test exam interface before deployment
2. Verify fullscreen works on target browsers
3. Ensure violation limits are appropriate
4. Test violation logging and tracking
5. Review violation reports after exams
6. Provide clear instructions to students

### **For Instructors (Monitoring)**:
1. Review violation logs for suspicious patterns
2. Check timing data for anomalies
3. Cross-reference violation counts with scores
4. Investigate students with multiple violations
5. Use violation data as one factor, not sole evidence

## 🔐 Security Level Assessment

### **Current Security Level: MEDIUM-HIGH** ✅
