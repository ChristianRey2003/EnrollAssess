## üîí Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### Immediate Rollback
1. Stop using `/admin/exam-assignments/assign` endpoint
2. Use legacy `exam_set_id` assignment (unchanged)
3. System continues to work normally

### Full Rollback
```bash
# Rollback migration (removes new tables/columns)
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1

# Verify rollback
php artisan migrate:status

# Remove new code files (optional)
rm app/Models/ExamAssignment.php
rm app/Models/ExamAssignmentQuestion.php
rm app/Services/QuestionSelectionService.php
rm app/Http/Controllers/ExamAssignmentController.php

# Revert route changes (git)
git restore routes/admin.php

# Revert controller changes (git)
git restore app/Http/Controllers/ExamController.php

# Revert model changes (git)
git restore app/Models/Exam.php
git restore app/Models/Applicant.php
git restore app/Models/Question.php
```

### Data Safety
- ‚úÖ No legacy data is modified
- ‚úÖ Rollback is safe (new tables are independent)
- ‚úÖ Can re-apply migration later

## üìù Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **Dual Flow Support**: Allows gradual migration, no forced upgrade
2. **Idempotent Generation**: Prevents duplicate assignments, safe to retry
3. **Quota Flexibility**: Optional quotas, can be null for random mix
4. **Graceful Deprecation**: 410 Gone instead of 404, provides redirect info
5. **Transaction Safety**: All assignment generation in single transaction
6. **Session Flag**: `use_assignment` prevents flow confusion

### Lessons Learned
1. Making `exam_set_id` nullable requires careful migration handling
2. Dual flow requires session state tracking
3. Option shuffle must persist per assignment (not per question)
4. Validation should happen at service layer (controller just validates input format)
5. Graceful deprecation is better than hard breaks

### Future Considerations
1. Consider archiving old assignments after 1 year
2. Consider caching for frequently accessed assignments
3. Consider background jobs for large batches (100+ applicants)
4. Consider analytics: which questions are most missed?
5. Consider difficulty calibration based on success rates
